# P5CLTCONV
Converts some binary data file formats from P5R (PS4) to P5 (PS3)

What started out as a CLT converter slowly gained many different formats to convert, so here we are now.

Currently supports the following file formats:  
- Field pac .CLT files
- FNPC (both regular and KFE variants) binary files (.ent/.fnt)
- Corptbl bin files (These are basically just an fnpc variant)
- Icon parts bin files
- ShdPersona and ShdPersonaEnemy files (.pdd)
- fldBGMCnd FTD file
- Field pac hit collision files (.HTB)
- texture/icon SPD files
- field pac camera PCD files (experimental)
- Field Environment .ENV files
- Speaker.dat
- fldSaveDataPlace.ftd
